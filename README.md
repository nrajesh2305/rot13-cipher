# ROT13 Cipher Project

# How to Use

To use the ROT13 Cipher, simply input your message into the prompt, and it will return back a encrypted or decrypted message. This is because the algorithm for both encrypting and decrypting a message is roughly the same, in that it always shifts 13 places.

# Information about Cipher Use Cases + Extra Information

The ROT13 Cipher is used to conceal non-sensitive information, such as spoilers, or trivia answers, so it's not read unintentionally. More information regarding the ROT13 Cipher can be found on its Wikipedia page.
